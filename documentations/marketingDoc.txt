Project name : Stack
Infpormation : [
	"In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements",
	"Stacks provide a unique way to work with contiguous memory",
	"Very similar to Arrays and Lists, Stacks provide a way for users to access different pieces of contiguous data in a Last In First Out manner.Imagine if you were looking at a stack of books. Whenever you wanted to add a book to the stack, it would be very easy to put it on top. Likewise, if you wanted to grab a book from the stack, it would be very easy just to grab the book on top.",
	"Stack is an important data structure"
]

Advantages : [
	"Easy to use",
	"Easier debugging/fixing of production code"
	"Easier training of team members"
	"Stack is a simple data structure for storing data"
	"Less Hardware Requirement"
	"In array we can't allocate memory dynamically so to remove this drawback we use stack. In stack we can allocate memory dynamically"
	"In array it take lots of effort to add new element or remove an element. In stack we can easily add or remove elements from stack"

Dis advantages : [
	"not flexible"
	"Unable to Copy & Paste"
