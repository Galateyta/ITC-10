The first method is as simple as specifying the filename of the script itself. In fact the first and the second method are both identical. 
The first method executes the script by using ./example_script, which means you are expected to be located in the same directory where the script is located. 


The third method (shown previosly), specifies the interpreter in the command line itself. If you are specifying the interpreter in the command line while executing the script(ie: the third method above, /bin/bash example_script.sh OR /bin/bash /path/to/example_script.sh) then the shebang will be ignored. In this case the interpreter specified in the command line will be used instead. 


Fouth method is exactly similar to the third method. This is because sh interpreter used in this method(sh example_script.sh) is most of the times symlinked to /bin/bash. 

The fifth method of executing the shell script is . ./example_script.sh.
