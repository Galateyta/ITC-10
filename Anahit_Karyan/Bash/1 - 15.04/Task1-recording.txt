First I record macro to change a line and then create other one to run that for  lines.
The macro @a:
                gg - start of file
		Esc - normal mode
		:s/^/1/g - change ^ to 1
                qa - start recording
                y - copy
		j - desecd to the next line
		p - past
		cntr+a - increment
		q - end record
